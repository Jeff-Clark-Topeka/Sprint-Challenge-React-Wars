1. What is React JS and what problems does it solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

ReactJS is a library that allows us to create webpages that are less bloated. The main problem it solves is making pages load information faster by only loading new data to the page instead of reloading the whole page.

1. Describe component state.

A Component State is an object of properties that control the behavior of the component.  

1. Describe props.

Props or properties is a keyword in React that allows us to pass data from one component to another. 

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to changes of certain state or props?

Side effects happen when a function tries to change the behavior of anything outside its scope. For example, if it tries to change something on the global scope then it is known as a side effect. We use a react hook or "useEffect" function to sync effects in a React Component to reduce side effects.
